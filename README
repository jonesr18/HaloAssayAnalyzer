This will be a repository for senior UW bioengineering students to post their projects. 

Ideally, this will lead to students sharing their work for future students to implement or improve upon while completing their own work.

In order to contribute, create a new branch for your project and put your files in that branch. 

You may organize your branch however you like, though please try to have self-descriptive file names or a README file which explains the purpose of each file.

Thank you for your contribution to future learning!
