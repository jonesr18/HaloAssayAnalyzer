This will be a repository for senior UW bioengineering students to post their projects. Ideally, this will lead to students sharing their work for future students to implement or improve upon while completing their own work.

In order to contribute, create a new fodler for your project and put your files in that branch. By convention, the folder should have your name and graduation year in it; so for my project, the folder name is "Ross Jones ('14)"

You may organize your folder however you like, though please attempt to make it somewhat navigatable; ie do not just paste every file you have ever used into the directory and call it good. 

Thank you for your contribution to future learning!
